        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>My name is Alexandra Dominguez, I am twenty and I have always had an affinity for traveling.</p>
        <p>I have had the privilege of traveling to various locations across the world, and hope to expand the list of countries and places I have been in the future.</p>
        <p>What I enjoy the most about traveling is the opportunity to immerse myself in different cultures, communities, and food.</p> 
        <p>I hope that this website can convey my love of traveling and adequately portray the beautiful cultures and places I have seen.</p>
        <p>I hope this can be conveyed through the pictures I took of both myslef and the scenery to capture the essence of each place I have traveled!</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about sharing my travel experiences and inspiring others to explore the world around them.</p>
