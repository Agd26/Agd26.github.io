    <h1>Alexandra Dominguez</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p>Introduction: My name is Alexandra Dominguez I am a current Sophmore at the University of Miami majoring in Journalism with minors in Marketing, English and Spanish. I was born and raised in Miami Florida.</p>
    <p>I went to an all-girls, Catholic Highschool where I learned to speak chinese. I chose to learn chinese as I already practice speaking spanish at home since both my parents are hispanic. I chose to attend the University of Miami to pursue a major in English, and then decided to switch over to a more practical career path as I do not have an affinity for teaching.  </p>

    <h2>Section 2: Features</h2>
    <p>Features: I recieved my International Baccalaureate degree with high scores in english, chinese and history. I am looking forward to completeing my undergraduate degree and  figuring out what I would like to do with my major and three minors. I am most passionate about writing and reading. </p>
